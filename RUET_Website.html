            <P class="Paragraph-1">Computer Science & Engineering has become the resilient part of engineering
                discipline that combines the
                knowledge of computer science, computer engineering and electrical engineering to develop and
                integrate
                computer software and hardware. Computer engineers tackled many aspects of computing in software and
                hardware, from writing software/firmware for embedded microcontroller or developing operating
                systems to
                the
                design of individual microcontroller/microprocessor, personal computer, supercomputer or very basic
                like
                circuit/VLSI-Chip design.</P>

            <P class="Paragraph-2">Welcome to the Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) of Rajshahi
                University of Engineering & Technology. CSE has an illustrious tradition of success dating from 1998.
                Our success has been due to the collective vision, labor and caring of dedicated departmental
                administration, faculty, staff and students. We provide 4 years B. Sc. Engineering in Computer Science &
                Engineering course 2 years M.Sc. and 3 years PhD Program to the local and foreign students. About 120
                students get undergraduate bachelor's degrees from this department each year. We have a dynamic,
                experienced and accomplished faculty, not to mention a dedicated support staff for your administrative
                and computing needs. All faculty members teach; most also do research and publish scholarly papers.
                Faculty members involve undergraduate and graduate students in research projects. Take the time to visit
                homepages of individual faculty members. On behalf of the faculty and staff, I want to encourage you to
                participate in this department. Although your first concern is your own academic success, you have a
                role to play in moving the department ahead. You are expected to be a good citizen and exhibit the
                highest standards of academic and professional integrity. Many opportunities will arise for you to
                represent this department and the university: do so with distinction. You will find that other students
                can benefit from your knowledge, skills and leadership. Look for ways to serve others in the department.
                It is my wish that you will come to treasure your time in the CSE Department as a time of personal
                growth and contribution.</p>
